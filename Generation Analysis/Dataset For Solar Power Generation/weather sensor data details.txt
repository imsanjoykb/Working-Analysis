This data has been gathered at two solar power plants in India over a 34 day period. It has two pairs of files - each pair has one power generation dataset and one sensor readings dataset. The power generation datasets are gathered at the inverter level - each inverter has multiple lines of solar panels attached to it. The sensor data is gathered at a plant level - single array of sensors optimally placed at the plant.

There are a few areas of concern at the solar power plant -

Can we predict the power generation for next couple of days? - this allows for better grid management
Can we identify the need for panel cleaning/maintenance?
Can we identify faulty or suboptimally performing equipment?

Attribute Details :
DATE_TIME - Date and time for each observation. Observations recorded at 15 minute intervals.

Plant ID - this will be common for the entire file.

SOURCE_KEY - Stands for the sensor panel id. This will be common for the entire file because there's only one sensor panel for the plant.

AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE - This is the ambient temperature at the plant.

MODULE_TEMPERATURE - There's a module (solar panel) attached to the sensor panel. This is the temperature reading for that module.

IRRADIATION - Amount of irradiation for the 15 minute interval.
